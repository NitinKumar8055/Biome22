Our solution automates a standard Hydroponics System to create it  a more Economical and Unsupervised. Hydroponics offers a growing technique which features a soil-less environment were the plant roots are exposed to a nutrient-enriched water solution. Although it's an efficient technique it requires continuous monitoring and management. An automated hydroponics system gives you complete control over water quality, temperature and precise nutrients needed to feed your plants. This provides us a complete system that automatically takes all the responsibilities of water irrigation, water recycling, and multiple feed formulas all sent to nurture your crops on daily schedules. It's a considerable boost in production and can lower your labour, energy and fertilizer costs.
